%description
The source code for the PSM2 messaging API, libpsm2.
A low-level user-level communications interface for the Intel(R) OPA
family of products. PSM2 users are enabled with mechanisms
necessary to implement higher level communications
interfaces in parallel environments.

# In distro's other than SLES >=12.3 we use a single description

%description -n @RPM_NAME@@RPM_NAME_BASEEXT@
PSM2 Messaging API, or PSM2 API, is the low-level
user-level communications interface for the Intel(R) OPA
family of products. PSM2 users are enabled with mechanisms
necessary to implement higher level communications
interfaces in parallel environments.

%description -n @RPM_NAME@-devel
Intel(R) PSM2, psm2*.h, headers and libpsm2.so files necessary
for developing software using libpsm2.

%description -n @RPM_NAME@-compat
Support for MPIs linked with PSM versions < 2. This will allow
software compiled to use Intel(R) Truescale PSM, libinfinipath, to run
with Intel(R) OPA PSM2, libpsm2.
