%description
The source code for the PSM2 messaging API, libpsm2.
A low-level user-level communications interface for the Intel(R) OPA
family of products. PSM2 users are enabled with mechanisms
necessary to implement higher level communications
interfaces in parallel environments.

PSM2 Messaging API, or PSM2 API, is the low-level
user-level communications interface for the Intel(R) OPA
family of products. PSM2 users are enabled with mechanisms
necessary to implement higher level communications
interfaces in parallel environments.

%description -n @RPM_NAME@-devel
Intel(R) PSM2, psm2*.h, headers and libpsm2.so files necessary
for developing software using libpsm2.

%description -n @RPM_NAME@-compat
Support for MPIs linked with PSM versions < 2. This will allow
software compiled to use Intel(R) Truescale PSM, libinfinipath, to run
with Intel(R) OPA PSM2, libpsm2.
