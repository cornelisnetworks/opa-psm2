INTRODUCTION
============

This README file discusses how to build, install and test the PSM2 library
source code.

The PSM2 library supports a number of fabric media and stacks, and all of
them run on version 7.X of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (abbreviated: RHEL), and
SuSE SLES.

Only the x86_64 architecture is supported.

Building PSM2 is possible on RHEL 7.2+ as it ships with hfi1 kernel driver.
For older RHEL 7.x versions and SuSE SLES, OPA is not natively supported
in the kernel and therefore, building PSM2 is not possible unless
you have the correct kernel-devel package or use latest versions of IFS.

There are two mechanisms for building and installing the PSM2 library:

  1. Use provided Makefiles to build and install or
  2. Generate the *.rpm files which you can then install using either
     yum or dnf command

DEPENDENCIES
============

The following packages are required to build the PSM2 library source code:
(all packages are for the x86_64 architecture)

compat-rdma-devel
gcc-4.8.2
glibc-devel
glibc-headers
kernel-headers

Additional packages for GPU Direct support include:
NVIDIA CUDA toolkit 8.0 or greater. Older versions are not supported.

In addition to depending on these packages, root privileges are required to
install the runtime libraries and development header files into standard
system location.

BUILDING
========

The instructions below use $BASENAME, $PRODUCT and $RELEASE to refer to
the base name of the tarball, RPM that will be generated and the product
and release identifiers of the RPM.

The base name of the RPM changes depending on which version/branch
of code you derive the tar file from.

Up until v10.2 of PSM2, the base name for the RPM is hfi1-psm.
From v10.2 onwards, the base name will be libpsm2. The internal
library remains unchanged and is still libpsm2.so.2.

BUILDING USING MAKEFILES
------------------------

1. Untar the tarball:
	$ tar zxvf $BASENAME-$PRODUCT-$RELEASE.tar.gz
2. Change directory into the untarred location:
	$ cd $BASENAME-$PRODUCT-$RELEASE
3. Run make on the command line. This will build the PSM2 library.
	$ make
  3.1. Optionally to build PSM2 library with GPU Direct support, Run make
       PSM_CUDA=1 instead of make on the command line.
      $ make PSM_CUDA=1

BUILDING USING RPMBUILD
-----------------------

1. Run this command from your $PWD to generate rpm, srpm files
	$ ./makesrpm.sh a

  This command results in the following collection of rpm's and source
  code rpm's under your $PWD/temp.X/ directory.
  ("X" is the pid of the bash script that created the srpm and rpm files)
  (Result shown here for RHEL systems.)

  RPMS/x86_64/libpsm2-compat-10.3.7-1x86_64.rpm
  RPMS/x86_64/libpsm2-devel-10.3.7-1x86_64.rpm
  RPMS/x86_64/libpsm2-10.3.7-1x86_64.rpm
  RPMS/x86_64/libpsm2-debuginfo-10.3.7-1x86_64.rpm
  SRPMS/libpsm2-10.3.7-1.src.rpm

  1.1. Optionally for GPU Direct support run this command from your $PWD to
       generate rpm, srpm files
       $ ./makesrpm.sh a -cuda

      This command results in the following collection of rpm's and source code
      rpm's under your $PWD/temp.X/ directory. ("X" is the pid of the bash
      script that created the srpm and rpm files):
      RPMS/x86_64/libpsm2-10.3.7-1cuda.x86_64.rpm
      RPMS/x86_64/libpsm2-compat-10.3.7-1cuda.x86_64.rpm
      RPMS/x86_64/libpsm2-devel-10.3.7-1cuda.x86_64.rpm
      SRPMS/x86_64/libpsm2-10.3.7-1cuda.src.rpm

  On systems with SLES 12.3 or newer, the package name for the base libpsm2
  RPM will be:
  	libpsm2-2-10.3.7-1.x86_64.rpm

  Other supporting RPM package names will be as listed above.

INSTALLING
==========

INSTALLING USING MAKEFILE
-------------------------

Install the libraries and header files on the system (as root):
	$ make install

The libraries will be installed in /usr/lib64, and the header files will
be installed in /usr/include.

This behavior can be altered by using the "DESTDIR" and "LIBDIR" variables on
the "make install" command line. "DESTDIR" will add a leading path component
to the overall install path and "LIBDIR" will change the path where libraries
will be installed. For example, "make DESTDIR=/tmp/psm-install install" will
install all files (libraries and headers) into "/tmp/psm-install/usr/...",
"make DESTDIR=/tmp/psm-install LIBDIR=/libraries install" will install the
libraries in "/tmp/psm-install/libraries" and the headers in
"/tmp/psm-install/usr/include", and "make LIBDIR=/tmp/libs install" will
install the libraries in "/tmp/libs" and the headers in "/usr/include".


INSTALLING USING EITHER YUM OR DNF
----------------------------------

You can install the rpm's and source rpm's previously built using rpmbuild using
either the yum or dnf command as the root user.  See the appropriate man page for
details of installing rpm's.

Note: It is also possible to use rpm command to install rpm's, but it is recommended
that one use yum/dnf as rpm tool has issues with name changes and obsoletes tags.
yum or dnf should be better able to resolve dependency issues.

RELATED SOFTWARE TO PSM2
========================

MPI Libraries supported
-----------------------
A large number of open source (OpenMPI, MVAPICH2) and Vendor MPI
implementations support PSM2 for optimized communication on HCAs. Vendor MPI
implementations (HP-MPI, Intel MPI 4.0 with PMI, Platform/Scali MPI)
require that the PSM2 runtime libraries be installed and available on
each node. Usually a configuration file or a command line switch to mpirun
needs to be specified to utilize the PSM2 transport.

OpenMPI support
---------------
It is recommended to use the v1.10.4 or newer version of OpenMPI.
Prior versions of OpenMPI have an issue with support PSM2 network transports
mixed with standard Verbs transport (BTL openib). This prevents an OpenMPI
installation with network modules available for PSM2 and Verbs to work
correctly on nodes with no HFI hardware. This has been fixed in the
latest development branch allowing a single OpenMPI installation to target
HFI hardware via PSM2 or Verbs as well as alternate transports seamlessly.

If NVIDIA CUDA support is desired, you can use the OpenMPI build
(v1.10.4-cuda-hfi) provided by Intel in the IFS installer v10.4.X or newer.
The changes have also been accepted into v3.0.x branch of upstream OpenMPI
repository. Therefore subsequent v3.0.x versions of OpenMPI should carry the
required OpenMPI support for PSM2 GPUDirect feature.

PSM2 header and runtime files need to be installed on a node where the OpenMPI
build is performed. All compute nodes additionally should have the PSM2 runtime
libraries available on them. OpenMPI provides a standard configure, make and
make install mechanism which will detect and build the relevant PSM2 network
modules for OpenMPI once the header and runtime files are detected.

MVAPICH2 support
----------------
MVAPICH2 supports PSM2 transport for optimized communication on HFI hardware.
OPA IFS supports MVAPICH2 v2.1 (or later). PSM2 header and runtime files
need to be installed on a node where MVAPICH2 builds are performed. All
compute nodes should also have the PSM2 runtime libraries available on them.

For building and installing MVAPICH2 with OPA support, refer to MVAPICH2
user guides here:
http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/static/media/mvapich/mvapich2-2.2rc1-userguide.html

(Note: Support for PSM2 is currently on v2.2rc1 of OSU MVAPICH2 code base.
The above link might change when a stable v2.2 is released.)

OFED Support
------------
Intel OPA is not yet included within OFED. But the hfi1 driver is available
publicly at kernel.org. Please do pull the driver from either kernel.org or
the github page for opa-hfi1 driver (https://github.com/01org/opa-hfi1)

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION
------------------------
PSM2 Programmer's Guide is published along with documentation for "Intel® Omni-Path
Host Fabric Interface PCIe Adapter 100 Series"
(http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/network-and-i-o/fabric-products/000016242.html)

Refer to this document for description on APIs and environment variables that
are available for use. For sample code on writing applications leveraging the
PSM2 APIs, refer to Section 5.

Link to latest (as of Sep 2017) PSM2 Programmer's Guide:
https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/network-and-i-o/fabric-products/Intel_PSM2_PG_H76473_v7_0.pdf

PSM Compatibility Support
------------

libpsm2-compat suppports applications that use the PSM API instead of
the PSM2 API, through a compatibility library. This library is an interface
between PSM applications and the PSM2 API.

If the system has an application that is coded to use PSM and has requirements
to use PSM2 (i.e. the host has Omni-Path hardware), the compatibility library
must be used.

Please refer to your operating system's documentation to find how to modify the
order in which system directories are searched for dynamic libraries. The
libpsm2-compat version of libpsm_infinipath.so.1 must be earlier on the search
path than that of libpsm-infinipath. Doing so allows applications coded to PSM
to transparently use the PSM2 API and devices which require it.

Please note that the installation path for the libpsm2-compat version of
libpsm_infinipath.so.1 will differ depending on your operating system
specifics. Common locations include:
- /usr/lib64/psm2-compat/
- /usr/lib/psm2-compat/
